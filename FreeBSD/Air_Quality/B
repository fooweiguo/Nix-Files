Health Implications:
Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate
health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to
air pollution.

Cautionary statement for PM2.5: 
Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma,
should limit prolonged outdoor exertion.
